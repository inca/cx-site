<h1 id="orm">Circumflex ORM</h1>
<p>Circumflex ORM is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational&#95;mapping" title="ORM definition on Wikipedia">Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)</a> framework for creating fast, concise and efficient data-centric applications with elegant DSL.</p>
<p>The term &laquo;Object-Relational Mapping&raquo; refers to the technique of mapping a data representation from an object model to a relational data model. ORM tools may significantly speed up development by eliminating boilerplates for common <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,&#95;read,&#95;update&#95;and&#95;delete" title="CRUD definition on Wikipedia">CRUD</a> operations, making applications more portable by incapsulating vendor-specific SQL dialects, providing object-oriented API for querying, allowing transparent navigation between object associations and much more.</p>
