Circumflex unites several self-contained open source projects for quick and robust application
development using [Scala][] programming language.

Cirumflex is ...

  * [Web Framework](/products.html#web) -- a DSL for quick web application development.
  * [ORM](/products.html#orm) -- Is used for creating fast, concise and efficient data-centric applications
      with elegant DSL.
  * [FreeMarker Helper](/products.html#ftl) -- helps to render most advanced Java templating language, FreeMarker.
  * [Markeven](/products.html#me) -- the new text-to-html conversion tool for writers.
  * [Scalate](/products.html#scalate) -- contains rendering methods and configuration objects for Scalate Templating Engine
  * [Docco](/products.html#docco) -- produces HTML that displays your comments alongside your code.
  * [Maven Plugin](/plugin.html)

Each Circumflex project focuses on code quality, simplicity and consistency -- such
forgotten merits in todays race for features and enterprise panacea-like solutions.
We make every effort to keep [Circumflex codebase](/api) concise, elegant and balanced.
