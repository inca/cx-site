Circumflex unites several self-contained open source projects for quick and robust application
development using [Scala][] programming language.

  * [Circumflex Web Framework](/products.html#web)
  * [Circumflex ORM](/products.html#orm)
  * [Circumflex FreeMarker Helper](/products.html#ftl)
  * [Circumflex Markeven](/products.html#me)
  * [Circumflex Scalate](/products.html#scalate)
  * [Circumflex Docco](/products.html#docco)
  * [Circumflex Maven Plugin](/plugin.html)

Each Circumflex project focuses on code quality, simplicity and consistency -- such
forgotten merits in todays race for features and enterprise panacea-like solutions.
We make every effort to keep [Circumflex codebase](/api) concise, elegant and balanced.

# Why Circumflex? {#why}

  * Circumflex projects require minimum initial configuration, while still allowing
  developers to easily override defaults if necessary.
  * Circumflex projects are written in Scala. They have all the benefits of Scala.
  They run on the JVM. They are fast. They are concise.
  * Circumflex does not try to solve all the problems a developer might ever face.
  It maintains a minimal features set, allowing developers to choose the tools and libraries
  which best suit their particular needs.
  * Circumflex is designed to use the powers of the Apache Maven 2 software management
  platform. Adding Circumflex components to your project is a matter of few more lines
  in your `pom.xml`.
  * All Circumflex components are designed to maximize the ease-of-use and clarity of your code.
  The development process with Circumflex is intuitive and extremely productive. 
  * Circumflex is completely free, with a BSD-style [license](/license.html).
