<h1 id="docco">Docco</h1>
<p>Docco is a quick-and-dirty, hundred-line-long, literate-programming-style documentation generator. It produces HTML that displays your comments alongside your code.</p>
<p>Circumflex Docco is a port of <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/docco">Docco Project</a> for Scala. The ideas of documenting open-source Scala programs in Docco style are under evaluation for now, but you still might want to try it and let us know, what you think about it.</p>
