      <h1>Featuring Simplicity <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Flexibility</h1>
      <p><img src="/img/wg-web.png"/> Circumflex Web Framework is a minimalistic DSL for quick and robust Web application development.</p>
      <p>It makes no assumtions of your applications and maintains limited feature set allowing you to use your favorite tools and libraries. Due to its unobtrusive nature it also plays nicely with different frameworks and view technologies. <a href="/projects/web/index.html">Read more &rarr;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h1>Data Definition <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Querying DSL</h1>
      <p>Circumflex ORM is an Object-Relational Mapping framework for creating concise and efficient data-centric applications with elegant DSL.</p>
      <p>The data definition DSL and querying API of Circumflex ORM closely resemble SQL &mdash; native language of modern databases.</p>
      <p><img src="/img/wg-orm.png"/> Feature list includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>lazy and eager fetching strategies for associations,</li>
        <li>complex queries, including subqueries of all kinds, data manipulation statements and set operations;</li>
        <li>transaction-scoped and application-scoped caching;</li>
        <li>schema generation and data import from XML;</li>
        <li>and other cute stuff.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Creating Meaningful Content</h1>
      <p>Circumflex Markeven is a tool for converting semantic plain text into valid HTML markup.</p>
      <p><img src="/img/wg-markeven.png"/> It is based on <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, a famous tool ported to several languages, but has more strict stucture and improved performance.</p>
      <p>Markeven is a &ldquo;golden middle&rdquo; in a range of markup technologies: from human-readable visually appealing formats which are hard for semantic analysis to strict XML-like languages designed for machines and barely legible for human being. <a href="/projects/markeven/index.html">Read more &rarr;</a></p>

      <h1>Code Which Reads Like A Book</h1>
      <p>Circumflex Docco is a Scala port of <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/docco">Docco project</a>. It offers an alternative approach to maintain source code documentation in a literate programming style.</p>
      <p><img src="/img/wg-docco.png"/></p>
      <p>Unlike standard documentation tools Docco encourages developers to express their thoughts consistently by providing explanations, instructions, HOWTOs and usage scenarios side-by-side with corresponding code fragments.</p>
      <p><a href="/api">Circumflex codebase</a> is a live example of how Docco works. <a href="/projects/docco/index.html">Read more &rarr;</a></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>Each Circumflex project focuses on code quality, simplicity and consistency &mdash; such forgotten merits in todays race for features and enterprise panacea-like solutions. We make every effort to keep <a href="/api">Circumflex codebase</a> concise, elegant and balanced.</p>

<h1 id="why">Why Circumflex?</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Circumflex projects require minimum initial configuration, while still allowing developers to easily override defaults if necessary.</li>
  <li>Circumflex projects are written in Scala. They have all the benefits of Scala. They run on the JVM. They are fast. They are concise.</li>
  <li>None of Circumflex projects tries to solve all the problems a developer might ever face. They focus on specific problems and are designed to play well with other tools and libraries.</li>
  <li>Circumflex is designed to use the powers of the Apache Maven 2 software management platform. Adding Circumflex components to your project is a matter of few more lines in your <code>pom.xml</code>.</li>
  <li>All Circumflex components are designed to maximize the ease-of-use and clarity of your code. The development process with Circumflex is intuitive and extremely productive.</li>
  <li>Circumflex is completely free, with a BSD-style <a href="/license.html">license</a>.</li>
</ul>
