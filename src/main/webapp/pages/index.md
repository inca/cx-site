Introducing Circumflex  {#intro}
======================

Circumflex is a set of software components for quick and robust application development
using the [Scala][] programming language.

Circumflex consists of several separate projects:

  * [Circumflex Web Framework](#web)
  * [Circumflex ORM](#orm)
  * [Circumflex FreeMarker Views](#ftl)
  * [Circumflex Markdown](#md)
  * [Circumflex Docco](#docco)
  * [Circumflex Maven Plugin](/plugin.html)

## At a glance  {#glance}

All Circumflex components share the same philosophy: the development process should be
natural and intuitive. They rely on Scala's support for domain-specific languages that make
development extremely efficient. And simple.

### Web Framework  {#web}

[Circumflex Web Framework](/web.html) is a DSL for quick web application development.

It is designed around the *route concept*. A route is an HTTP method with matching mechanism
and attached block. The application itself is essentially a sequential set of routes: they are
matched in the order they are defined, the first route that matches the request is invoked.

Here's a simple web application:

    lang:scala
    class Main extends RequestRouter {
      get("/") = "Hello world!"
      get("/posts/:id") = "Post #" + uri("id")
      post("/form") = {
        // Do some work
        // . . .
        // Render FreeMarker template:
        ftl("/done.ftl")
      }
    }

Of course, the capabilities of Web framework are not limited to responding to HTTP methods and
matching URLs. Check out the [Circumflex Web Framework page](/web.html) for detailed overview.

### ORM  {#orm}

What can possibly be better than designing the domain model using the domain specific language
that closely resembles the data definition language of SQL databases?

    lang:scala
    class City extends Record[City] {
      val name = "name" TEXT
      val country = "country_id" REFERENCES(Country) ON_DELETE CASCADE ON_UPDATE CASCADE
      override def toString = name.getOrElse("Unknown")
    }

    object City extends Table[City]

    class Country extends Record[Country] {
      val code = "code" VARCHAR(2) DEFAULT("'ch'")
      val name = "name" TEXT
      def cities = inverse(City.country)
      override def toString = name.getOrElse("Unknown")
    }

    object Country extends Table[Country] {
      INDEX("country_code_idx", "LOWER(code)") USING "btree" UNIQUE
    }

But still it is nothing comparing to object-oriented querying:

    lang:scala
    // Prepare the relations that will participate in queries:
    val ci = City as "ci"
    val co = Country as "co"
    // Select all russian cities, return Seq[City]:
    SELECT (ci.*) FROM (ci JOIN co) WHERE (co.code LIKE "ru") ORDER_BY (ci.name ASC) list
    // Select countries with corresponding cities, return Seq[(Country, City)]:
    SELECT (co.*, ci.*) FROM (co JOIN ci) list
    // Select countries and count their cities, return Seq[(Country, Int)]:
    SELECT (co.*, COUNT(ci.id)) FROM (co JOIN ci) GROUP_BY (co.*) list

Circumflex ORM also features lazy and eager fetching strategies for associations, complex queries,
including subqueries of all kinds, data manipulation statements (`INSERT .. SELECT`, `UPDATE` and
`DELETE`), set operations between queries (`UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`),
transaction-scoped caching, xml data import, schema generation with Maven plugin and arbitrary projections.

For more information, please check out the [Circumflex ORM page](/orm.html).

### Markdown  {#md}

The infamous text-to-html conversion tool for writers, [Markdown][], is now available for Scala users
with some extensions and improved performance. The usage is pretty simple:

    lang:scala
    val html = Markdown(text)

You are welcome to try it [online](/.mdwn)!

### Freemarker  {#ftl}

Circumflex Freemarker module brings the power of the most advanced Java templating language,
[Freemarker][] to Scala. Due to the fact that Freemarker templates can effectively render any
possible content, the Freemarker is considered the main view technology for
[Circumflex Web Framework](#web).

### Docco  {#docco}

Circumflex Docco is a port of [Docco Project](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco) for Scala.
The ideas of documenting open-source Scala programs in Docco style are under evaluation for now,
but you still might want to try it and let us know, what you think about it.

## Why Circumflex? {#why}

  * Circumflex components require minimum initial configuration, while still allowing
  developers to easily override defaults if necessary.
  * Circumflex is based on Scala. It has all the benefits of Scala.
  It runs on the JVM. It is fast. It is concise.
  * Circumflex does not try to solve all the problems a developer might ever face.
  It maintains a minimal features set, allowing developers to choose the tools and libraries
  that best suit their particular needs.
  * Circumflex is designed to use the powers of the Apache Maven 2 software management
  platform. Adding Circumflex components to your project is a matter of few more lines
  in your `pom.xml`.
  * All Circumflex components are designed to maximize the ease-of-use and clarity of your code.
  The development process with Circumflex is intuitive and extremely productive. 
  * Circumflex is completely free, with a BSD-style [license](/license.html).

## Quick start  {#start}

### Use With Existing Projects  {#existing-projects}

If you already have a project and wish to use one of the Circumflex components, just
 add the corresponding dependency to your project's `pom.xml`:

    lang:xml
    <properties>
      <cx.version><!-- desired version --></cx.version>
    </properties>
    <dependencies>
      <!-- Circumflex Web Framework -->
      <dependency>
        <groupId>ru.circumflex</groupId>
        <artifactId>circumflex-core</artifactId>
        <version>{cx.version}</version>
      </dependency>
      <!-- Circumflex ORM -->
      <dependency>
        <groupId>ru.circumflex</groupId>
        <artifactId>circumflex-orm</artifactId>
        <version>{cx.version}</version>
      </dependency>
      <!-- Circumflex Freemarker Views -->
      <dependency>
        <groupId>ru.circumflex</groupId>
        <artifactId>circumflex-ftl</artifactId>
        <version>{cx.version}</version>
      </dependency>
      <!-- Circumflex Markdown -->
      <dependency>
        <groupId>ru.circumflex</groupId>
        <artifactId>circumflex-md</artifactId>
        <version>{cx.version}</version>
      </dependency>
      <!-- Circumflex Docco -->
      <dependency>
        <groupId>ru.circumflex</groupId>
        <artifactId>circumflex-docco</artifactId>
        <version>{cx.version}</version>
      </dependency>
    </dependencies>

Note that all Circumflex components should share the same version. Check out the
[Central Maven Repository][m2-central] to determine the latest version of Circumflex.

### Create New Project  {#new-projects}

As soon as Circumflex is built, you are ready to create your first project. Change
to the directory where you store your projects, and run:

    lang:no-highlight
    $ mvn archetype:generate

Choose the **circumflex-archetype** from your local catalog:

    lang:no-highlight
    Choose archetype:
    1: local -> circumflex-archetype (Circumflex Application Archetype)
    2: internal -> . . .
    Choose a number:  (1/2/3/ . . .) 17: : 1

Provide basic information about your project:

    lang:no-highlight
    Define value for groupId: : com.myapp
    Define value for artifactId: : myapp
    Define value for version:  1.0-SNAPSHOT: : 1.0
    Define value for package:  com.myapp: :

After you confirm your choice, a simple Circumflex application will be created. To run
it, go to your project root (it matches the `artifactId` that you specified above)
and execute the following:

    lang:no-highlight
    $ mvn compile jetty:run

The following lines indicate that your application is ready to serve requests:

    lang:no-highlight
    [INFO] Started Jetty Server
    [INFO] Starting scanner at interval of 5 seconds.

Now you may visit your application at <http://localhost:8180>.

### Build From Sources  {#sources}

You can obtain the latest Circumflex sources at [GitHub][gh-cx]:

    lang:no-highlight
    $ git clone git://github.com/inca/circumflex.git

Circumflex, like all Scala applications, is compiled into Java VM bytecode. Make sure
that the latest [Java 6 SDK][jdk] is installed on your system.

Circumflex uses [Apache Maven 2][m2] for build management. If you don't already have
Maven 2, [install it][m2-install]. Note that some operating systems (e.g. Mac OS X
10.5 and higher) are shipped with Maven 2 by default. On some systems it is also
preferrable to install Maven 2 via package managers. For example, on Debian or Ubuntu
systems you can install Maven 2 by executing the following line:

    lang:no-highlight
    $ sudo apt-get install maven2

If you are unfamiliar with Maven, you should probably read the [Maven in 5 Minutes][m2-5min]
article or [Getting Started Guide][m2-gsg].

Once you are ready to build, execute the following in the Circumflex root directory:

    lang:no-highlight
    $ mvn clean install

After the build has successfully finished, Circumflex with all its dependencies will
be available in your local Maven 2 repository (it may take a while to download
dependencies the first time).
